# Angular Node Seed with EveryAuth and Bootstrap


_This repo is inspired by [Angular Express Seed] (https://github.com/btford/angular-express-seed)._

_I could not find a single example application that worked fine with oauth. I always wanted a setup with
angular, server side ( rails or node! ) exposing api's with oauth for authentication and any nosql db. I couldnt find any
so I started writing my own. This would be my ideal setup for a project as well. Eventually I plan to expand this setup to
include all the technologies I mentioned above._

Start an awesome app with AngularJS on the front, Express + Node on the back. This project is an
application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app for those who want
to use Node to serve their app.

The seed contains angular libraries, test libraries and a bunch of scripts all preconfigured for
instant web development gratification. Just clone the repo (or download the zip/tarball) and
you're ready to develop your application.

The seed app shows how to wire together Angular client-side components with Express on the server.

##Note :

Unlike _Angular Express Seed_ this project uses html itself as the templating engine which I personally find more comfortable.

## How to use

Clone the express-angular repository and start hacking!

### Running the app

Runs like a typical express app:

    node app.js
